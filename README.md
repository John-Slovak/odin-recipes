Recipes WebPage created with the help of Odin

Before (The Plan):
I'm looking to make a simple Recipe webpage, a main page, and maybe 4 links to the 4 recipes presented with descriptions, lists, and pictures. I don't know yet what exactly Odin will want me to do, so I'm keeping it simple for now. The first drafts will be pure HTML, but later on I will hopefully get to add CSS and Java to make it look clean.

HTML done:
Finished the HTML core of the page. It's got a homepage, with 4 pictures with hyperlinks to 4 recipes. Pretty proud of the "skeleton" so far. The recipes have the basic description, ingredients and steps, and I also i had the idea to include some sort of "difficulty" scale, gonna do that later though as that is more of a graphical thing. HTML basics course is done, onto the CSS.
