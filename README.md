# odin-recipes
Recipes WebPage created with the help of Odin

Before (The Plan):
I'm looking to make a simple Recipe webpage, a main page, and maybe 4 links to the 4 recipes presented with descriptions, lists, and pictures. I don't know yet what exactly Odin will want me to do, so I'm keeping it simple for now. The first drafts will be pure HTML, but later on I will hopefully get to add CSS and Java to make it look clean.
