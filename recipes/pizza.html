            <ol>
                <li>Mash 2 garlic moons with either a knife or a masher, and throw them into a glass. Add just about half a cm worth of olive oil.</li> 
                <li>Spread little bit of olive oil on the baking pan so it doesn't stick, then proceed to spread the dough on it too. Make sure that the corners and sides are pointing upwards a bit.</li> 
                <li>Spread the garlic-oil mix on the dough evenly.</li> 
                <li>Spread the tomatoes extract on top of the mix evenly.</li> 
                <li>Throw all kinds of cheese on top of the tomatoes extract. The more the better, the more types of cheese the better.</li> 
                <li>Gently lay some prochutto salami slices on top of the cheese, covering it fully. Only leave out about a cm from the sides.</li>                
                <li>Add corn, and layer it up with even more cheese.</li> 
                <li>Put in preheated 250 degrees oven for 10 minutes.</li> 
                <li>Cut up and serve. Able to eat about 5 minutes post finish.</li>
